## Arrays or Vectors , which one to use?

For memory optimization reasons considering the length of the input can be different in any test case, and because vector has many built-in usefule methods (for example sort()) use [vectors](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) is better than use normal arrays.  

 
## Fibonacci numbers

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

In mathemicatical terms, the sequence of Fibonaccia is created by the following relation:
```Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2```, where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1;
