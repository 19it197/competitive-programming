# What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Progranning (C.P.) is a mind sport or e.sport where all the partecipants are called competitive coders and their task iis to solve a specific number of exercises within a specific time. 
 
## Who am I ,Where and When did I start

I am Davide Pollicino, Computer science student at the Edinburgh Napier university. 
My passion for competitive programming started in 2016, during the third year of Secondary High school, where I have partecipated two times to the OIS(Olimpiadi di informatica a squadre / Competitive Programming Olimpics game in Team), being part of the [Hbfs team, 21st position in Italy and 2nd in Sicily](https://squadre.olinfo.it/edition/9/team/sic20)  

Later on, during the COVID19 lookdown, I have decided to publish my solutions write these lectures for all the future Competitive Coders and keep practicing. 

Are you in Italy and you would like to start with a National competition between all the secondary high School? I have started from the [OIS](https://squadre.olinfo.it/).




## Platform for training:
* [Italian Olympiads in Informatics training](https://training.olinfo.it/#/overview)
* [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
* [Spoj.com](https://www.spoj.com/)
* [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
* [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
* [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

If you are asking yourself which one is the best platform for training, the answer is **all of them and all the platforms that you can find**.  Every platform has a different set of exercises, a different community and a different approach to the contests and theory. 

## Structure of the Lectures

I will not be here explaining you how do declare an integer or a string, instead, 
I will underline key concepts and give you some tips that you should keep in mind during your learning process and during the competitions.
