ALgorithm aren't just a collections of instructions. All the algorithm can be classified on the basis
of various characteristcs:
* Purpose
* Implemententaion: 
    -- Recursive oor Iteractive:Algorithm repeatedly calls itself until a certain
        condition is matched. Common in functional programming (e.g. Haskell, Erlang)
    -- Logical or procedural: a logical algorithm has problem expresses in terms of axioms, to which rules are applied to deduce a solution. 
    -- Serial or parallel: serial execute on ste at a tine wgerea a oarakkek algorithm allows multiple steps to occur toghether (which can take advantage of multiple CPUs, Cores, Threads). 
    -- Deterministic or non-deterministic: the algorithm solves a problem using a predefined process at each step wherea non-deterministc perform a best guess. 
* Desing Paradigm
* Probablistic / heurist paradigm
