ALgorithm: set of step that toghether solve a proble

Spa complexity: how much memory does it take to wokr

Tim ecomplexity how much time does it take to complete

Exact: Algortihm gives an exact result
Approximate: try to find an anser that could be correct or partially correct (as face recognition algorithm).


## Types of ALgorithm
* Search
* Sorting
* Computational: given one set of data calulcate another.
* Collection algorithm


## GCD of two numbers
GCD, Greatest common diminator: is the biggest number that can be used to divide both numbers a and b where the reminder is 0.
1. Fow two integer a and b, where a > b, divide a by b;
2. If the remainder, r, is 0: the GCD is b;
3. Otherwise, set a to b, b to r, and repeat at step 1 until r is 0;
