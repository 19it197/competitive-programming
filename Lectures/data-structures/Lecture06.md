## Stings

### Longest Common Subsequence


### Hamming distance problem

Find the number of different chars between equa-length strins.


String Alignment  problem definition: 

#### Needleman-Wunschâ€™s algorithm

### Longest Palindrome substring


### Suffix Array

Suffix array is a Data Structure created by Udi MAnber in 1991. Udi Manber is now one of the Google vice presidents of enginnering.

The suffix Array has similar functionalties to the Suffix Tree but much simpler to implement and even faster.
Suffix Tree has O(N) construction time while Suffix Array construction time is O(n log n).




### Suffix Tree

Applications:

## Knuth Morris Pratt's (KMP) Algorithm


### Find The longest Repated Substring 


### Find the Longest Common substring



### Other string Matchin ALgorithm

BOye-Moore's

Rabin-Karp#s


Aho-Corasicki's


Finite state Automata

## Just mind that 

We can use C++ STL map<string, int> to keep track the frequency
of each word. Every time we encounter a new token (which is a string), we increase the
corresponding frequency of that token by one. Finally, we scan through all tokens and
determine the one with the highest frequency.
