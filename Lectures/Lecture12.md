### Linked List

A linked lists is an alternative to the dynamic array that overcomes some of the limitations of the basics array. 
First of all, what could a limitation of the array?
* The size is fixed. 
* The need contiguous space memory (every element of the array needs to be stored concequentially). 

A linked list is so a linear data structure where:
* The first element of the list is called ```head```. 
* Each element points to the next iteam. 
* We iterate the list thourght by accessign the current iteam, pointing to the next iteam so so on... 


#### Characteristics of the Linked List

We have constant time for insertion and deletion time because we don't need any reoallocation or sorting of the linked list. It is dynamic, but it uses more memory than arrays (to keep always track of the next or previous elements, depends which Linked List we are using). 

#### Types of linked list

* **Singly linked list:** Each element stores it's own data and points to the next element. We can travers/iterate it in only one direction (from the start to the end). 
* **Doubly Linked List:** each element stores it's own data and pointer to both the next and previous elements. Of course, we can traverse/iterate it in both directiions. 
* **Circolar linked list:**
