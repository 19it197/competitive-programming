## Stack in Python
###### Materials tooken from the amazing www.geeksforgeeks.org

In python, it is possible to implement a stack using 
* list
* deque
* LifoQueue

For our implementation, we have decided to implement a stack using a list

## Queue
Queue in Python can be implemented by the following ways:

* list
* collections.deque
* queue.Queue

* Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
* Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are * pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
* Front: Get the front item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
*Rear: Get the last item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
