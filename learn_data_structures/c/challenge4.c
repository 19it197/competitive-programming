    Summary:Use a list structure to write the simplest of text-based dungeon crawler games. Each room
    in the dungeon should be a node in the list and your player must be able to navigate from
    room to room, having each room described to them as they progress. No need to consider
    monsters and treasure at this point, unless you want to. Just navigating between rooms can
    sometimes be a challenge at this point. Obviously this wonâ€™t be a great dungeon crawler as
    the rooms will be laid out in a linear pattern, but it should be enough to get you thinking
    about how you might use lists to represent features of your own programs.
