    Summary: Revisit your queue implementation from the last lab. Reimplement your queue API using
    a linked list as the storage collection instead of an Array. At the very least, all you really
    need are enqueue and dequeue functions for your list to enable you to (mis)use your list as
    a queue What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
