# Competitive-programming
Welcome to my Competitie Programming guide. 

## Who am I ,Where and When did I start

I am Davide Pollicino, Computer science student at the Edinburgh Napier university. 
My passion for competitive programming started in 2016, during the third year of Secondary High school, where I have partecipated two times to the OIS(Olimpiadi di informatica a squadre / Competitive Programming Olimpics game in Team), being part of the [Hbfs team, 21st position in Italy and 2nd in Sicily](https://squadre.olinfo.it/edition/9/team/sic20)  

Later on, during the COVID19 lookdown, I have decided to publish my solutions write these lectures for all the future Competitive Coders and keep practicing. 

Are you in Italy and you would like to start with a National competition between all the secondary high School? I have started from the [OIS](https://squadre.olinfo.it/).

## Are you a beginner?

Success in something the biggest form of satisfaction, so let's practice and learn. There are millions of devs outside your door, the are spaghetti code writers and good devs. 
The difference is in the practise. 

## Structure of the Repository

* [Hackerank/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/blob/master/HackerRank/README.md) : Contains a link that will bring you in a dedicated repository where I will upload day by day Hackerank problems solution.
* [Codechef/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/codechef) : Contains all the problems that I have solved in Codechef. 
* [algo_and_dataStructures/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/algo_and_dataStructure) : Contains most of the exerices that I have implemented to learn how to use a specific data structures and how to use the buit-in methods of a datastructure.
* [Geek For Geeks](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Geekforgeeks): My solutions of Geek for Geeks exercises.
* [Lectures/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Lectures) : Contains useful notes for review purposes.
* [Readings/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Reading) : Contains free ebooks extremely useful for C.P.

## Theory

If you have some basics of programming, for example you know already what a variable or function is, check the[Readings/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Reading) and [Lectures/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Lectures) folders.
