# Competitive-programming
Welcome to my Competitie Programming guide. 

## What you can find in this repository

You will find notes about algorithms and Datastructures, time and space analysis,useful tips about Competitive Programming approach and many of my coding challenghes solutions from platforms like:  HackerRank, CodeChef, GeeksForGeeks, UVA and so on. Here you will find most of these solutions that have passed with 100/100. 

## How to contribute?
1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When to contribute?
1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file and make a pull request.
5. If you woukd like to make any positive change to the lectures content

## I appreciate any feedback
Constructive criticisms or code reviews of any kind are very much welcome.

If you have any questions about the solutions you can find here, feel free to contact me at: [davidepollicino2015@gmail.com](mailto:davidepollicino2015@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20GeeksForGeeks)
