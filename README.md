# Competitive-programming
Welcome to my Competitie Programming guide. 

## When did I start?
My first approach to the C.P. (Competitive Programming) was during the 3rd year of the Secondary high school. 
I have partecipated twice to the [OIS Competitition in team](https://sites.google.com/aldini.istruzioneer.it/olimpiadi-informatica-squadre/homepage), and we have qualified 1st in regional Ranking and 
26th in the National Ranking. 

## Are you a beginner?
Trust me, everyone starts from the same level: 0.
