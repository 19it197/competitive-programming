# Competitive-programming
Welcome to my Competitie Programming guide. 

## Who am I ,Where and When did I start

I am Davide Pollicino, Computer science student at the Edinburgh Napier university. 
My passion for competitive programming started in 2016, during the third year of Secondary High school, where I have partecipated two times to the OIS(Olimpiadi di informatica a squadre / Competitive Programming Olimpics game in Team), being part of the [Hbfs team, 21st position in Italy and 2nd in Sicily](https://squadre.olinfo.it/edition/9/team/sic20)  

Later on, during the COVID19 lookdown, I have decided to publish my solutions write these lectures for all the future Competitive Coders and keep practicing. 

Are you in Italy and you would like to start with a National competition between all the secondary high School? I have started from the [OIS](https://squadre.olinfo.it/).

## Are you a beginner?

Well, Everyone started from the same level : 0. 

## Structure of the Repository

* [Lectures/](Lectures/): Contains useful notes for algorithms, data structures and tips for your competitive Programming contests.

## Theory

If you have some basics of programming, for example you know already what a variable or function is, check the[Readings/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Reading) and [Lectures/](https://github.com/omonimus1/competitive-programming/tree/master/Lectures) folders.
