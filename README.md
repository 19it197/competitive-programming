Welcome to my Competitie Programming guide. 

## Whe did I start?
My first approach to the C.P. (Competitive Programming) was during the 3rd year of the Secondary high school. 
I have partecipated twice to the OIS Competitition in team (HBFS team) and we have qualified 1st in regional Ranking and 
26th in the National Ranking. 

## Are you a beginner?
Trust me, everyone starts from the same level: 0. 

## Platform for training:
