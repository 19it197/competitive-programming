    Summary: Write a short program that stores the names and ages of a group of people and prints them
    out in order of age. Getting the order correct is possibly best done at construction time, as
    otherwise you will need a sort function6
    . You will also need to consider the data that each
    node of your list stores, our node struct so far has stored simple int values as their sole data,
    but now it looks like we need something a little more complex.
