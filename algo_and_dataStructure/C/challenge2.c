    Summary: Revisit your stack implementation from the last lab. Reimplement your stack API using a
    linked list as the storage collection instead of an Array. At the very least, all you really need
    is a push and pop function for your list to enable you to (mis)use your list as a stack. What
    are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
